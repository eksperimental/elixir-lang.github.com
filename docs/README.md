# Elixir's generated documentation

This repository holds Elixir's **generated** documentation and is not meant to be manually updated. The main repository for Elixir is [elixir-lang/elixir][elixir].

If you spot a bug, typo, or anything wrong with the documentation, you should report it in the main Elixir repository, and not here. This documentation is auto-generated from Elixir's source code (through a tool called [ExDoc][ex_doc]), so if you'd like to contribute fixes or improvements to the documentation, please visit the main Elixir repository and follow the contributions guidelines found there. Thanks!
